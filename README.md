## Bugs
* collaborate functionality does not work (only works on localhost - I need to learn how to use websockets across different domains)
* some content [headings] may not be exported - especially if you don't explicitly choose the default headings 

## Technology 
* NodeJS 
* Websockets (WSS) 
* ReactJS 
* formkit/auto-animate/react
* ReactQuill (QuillJS)  


## What I learned 
* websockets made me rethink how I take React's component lifecycle for granted when making simpler apps 
* formkit/auto-animate/react is awesome 
* QuillJS and the power of an HTML powered word processer (delta format etc)
